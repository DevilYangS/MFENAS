## Introduction
This is the source code of the paper entitled [*Accelerating Envolutionary Neural Architecture via Multi-Fidelity Evaluation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04541)

## Notes
The source code inlcluding searching, training and best models found by MFENAS will be released once the paper is accepted.

-------------------------------------------- **Current Version Notes**------------------------------------------

The current version is just a baseline approach for reference, the detailed explanation and useage will be given when this paper is accepted.
Of course, you can study this source code yourself to help your work.

To plot the architecture of found cells, you have to install *pygraphviz* package and use *Plot_network* function in **utils.py**.
